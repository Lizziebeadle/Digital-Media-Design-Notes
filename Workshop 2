Creating a simple project:
Create a class
Set up two variables of different types
Create a function

How do you create a class - key word/casing/brackets?
- provides a template/blueprint/design layout for your object.
- use the keyword ‘class’ followed by the name of the class. (use an uppercase when naming your class)
- space between curly brackets is where the properties and functions to do with that class are kept. 

class Person {

}

What is the difference between a variable and a constant? 
variable  'var' = an identifier with a value that can be changed during normal execution, i.e., the value is variable.
The variable name= is of type string/characters
The variable age= is of type integer/numbers
constant 'let' = value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution, i.e., the value is constant


What must you do after creating a variable?
methods= blocks of code that perfrom in specific task or functionality 


What does the word 'string' mean?
sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements to be mutated and the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation).
String = Charcaters

What key work (abreviation) is used to create a function?
Functions 'func'= A set of brackets and then a set of curly braces which contains whatever we want to function to do.

function print=
func bio(){
print("My name is \(self.name), I am \(self.age) from Bournemouth")

}

backslash and brackets= used in the print statement, take arguments/parameters. This function now accepts an argument of “name”. All this means is that when we call this function it's expecting a String to be passed to it which it can use, and it will be called name.

What symbol means 'is of type'?
‘:’

What does 'Int' mean?
Integer = (whole) Numbers

How do you print out a variable or function in the debug area?


Self= differentiate between the property ‘name’ and the parameter ‘name’.
parameter name= is in the brackets after 'init'
property name= is the variable you set at the beginning.
